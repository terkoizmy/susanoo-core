# AETHERIS

Autonomous AI-Powered Robotics for Hydrogen Infrastructure Inspection

## 📌 Project Overview
AETHERIS (System for Unified Surveillance and Autonomous Network Observation of Over-ground Energy) is an advanced simulation framework designed for the autonomous inspection of Green Hydrogen pipelines.

Developed for the lablab.ai "AI Meets Robotics" Hackathon, this project addresses the critical safety challenges of the hydrogen economy. By utilizing AI-driven robotics, AETHERIS automates the detection of structural anomalies and gas leaks in high-pressure environments, minimizing human risk and ensuring infrastructure integrity.

## 🚀 The Problem
As the world shifts toward Green Hydrogen, maintaining vast pipeline networks becomes a major challenge. Hydrogen is a highly volatile gas; even microscopic leaks can lead to significant hazards. Manual inspections are:
- Dangerous for human technicians.
- Inconsistent and prone to human error.
- Inefficient over long distances in remote areas.

## 🛠 Our Solution
AETHERIS provides a simulated autonomous robot agent capable of:
- Predictive Patrol: Navigating pipeline routes autonomously using AI-driven pathfinding.
- Anomaly Detection: Using computer vision and sensor fusion to identify cracks, corrosion, and pressure irregularities.
- Real-time Monitoring: Reporting health metrics and location data back to a centralized control hub.

## 🌟 Key Features
AI-Powered Vision: Real-time leak and defect detection using deep learning models.
- Robust Safety: Built with Rust to ensure system-level stability and prevent memory-related crashes during critical operations.
- Digital Twin Integration: Simulated environments that mirror real-world hydrogen facility physics.
- Modular Architecture: Easily adaptable for different types of energy infrastructure (Natural Gas, Solar Farms, etc.).
